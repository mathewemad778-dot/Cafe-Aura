Cafe Aura — Coffee Website Project

Cafe Aura is a modern single-page coffee website designed to showcase a premium café experience through clean layout, structured sections, and strong visual hierarchy. The goal of this project was to create a polished, responsive coffee website that demonstrates solid front-end fundamentals using HTML and CSS.

This project focuses heavily on layout structure, user experience, and visual design. Each section of the website was carefully planned to guide users naturally through the content — from the hero section to the menu, about section, opening hours, and contact form.

The navigation bar is built to allow smooth scrolling between sections, creating a seamless browsing experience. The hero section introduces the brand identity and establishes the aesthetic tone of the website. The menu grid was designed to display coffee items in a clean and organized way, using consistent card layouts and spacing.

Special attention was given to styling and color selection. A dark theme with warm accent colors was chosen to reflect the cozy atmosphere of a coffee shop. Typography and spacing were adjusted to improve readability and visual balance.

The project also demonstrates:

Responsive layout design principles

Structured content organization

CSS animations and hover effects

Clean component-based styling

Semantic visual hierarchy

Smooth scrolling navigation

Cafe Aura represents a strong foundation in front-end web development and serves as a stepping stone toward more interactive and advanced web applications.
